- 06 Smallest Not dividing number
  - Given a vector of integers find the smallest number, that doesn't divide any of the numbers in the vector.
- 07 BoxBlur
  - You were wasted last night and now you should blur some images.For each pixel you take the surrounding 8 and the current, and calculate their average. Then you round down the value.
  - You do this only for the inner pixels. (= you crop down the 1px round of the picture)
  - Input is a std::vector<std::vector<int>> and the answer should be in the same format.
- 08 MineSweeper
  - Given a 2D array of bools, in which true indicates a mine. For each field calculate the number of the neighboring mines, and return a 2D int array that contains these numbers.
- 09 Replacing vector values
  - Given an int vector / array replace each occurrence of "x" with "y"
- 10 Check if a number (n) contains only even digits.
- 11 Check if the string argument would be a valid variable name. (Not starting with digits, only containing letters, numbers and underscore.)
- 12 Shift each char in string by one. (z becomes a).
- 13 determine if two board cells are of the same color on a chess board. (input: "A1", "B1")
