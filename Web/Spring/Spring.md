# Spring
I think to directly jump start in Spring and Hibernate would be baffling for a java beginner , if one has really started learning Java. I would suggest the following plan:-
1) Learn java concepts and following packages must be studied in depth --> Read about technology. - java.io; java.utils;java.concurrent
2) Take up jsp and servlets --> Head First JSP and Servlets is good to understand the topic. Learn how different components are wired and how they talk to each other. Topics like db connection, pooling, jndi, session management etc. are important to be understood. Of course, you will also learn HTML and CSS to some extent.
3) Learn some design patterns in conjunction with step 2, like front controller, dispatcher, DAO, Business Delegate,Singleton, Session Facade etc again Head first design pattern is there and of course one can use GOF.
4) Step 2 and 3 seem important to me if one really has to understand and appreciate what Spring promises to provide, and instead of just configuring stuff in xml or just annotating , one can get an insight of why it is really being done in a particular way and basic guiding principle behind it. Topics like Transaction management, Security, Logging are important here. Also , slowly but surely be aware of java meta-programming which makes Spring the framework it is. Some rave on meta-programming from Chris Swanâ€™s web blog Metaprogramming, is a good read. If you are adventurous , this might get you interested in code generation , writing generic parsers etc. god knows what not !!
5) I know it's not that easy, and seems to have a steep learning curve,but it is worth it
6) Hibernate is a different beast altogether and if one has some knowledge of writing SQL and SQL tuning , then it's a good starting point to delve into it. Look up for some online tutorials, to begin with and then probably get a copy of Java persistence with Hibernate by Christian Bauer and Gavin King, to go deeper into hibernate. Topics like associations, fetch strategy, transaction management, connection pooling, caching etc are to look forward to.
7) Try to implement 3-4 projects using spring and hibernate and you will see your knowledge improving. This should also introduce you to Maven.
8) Of course, you will need to read Effective Java and Java Concurrency in Practice side by side.
Congratulations! you are a full java stack developer :-)



1) Understand Spring Framework comprehensively.

I read Craig Walls' Spring in Action book to achieve this.

This would help you understand what Spring Framework is. You will have a full understanding of all the concepts. You will be familiar with the capabilities and proper usage of Spring Framework for your projects.

2) Get real world examples of the Spring Framework that can use in your application.

I read Daniel Rubio and Josh Long's Spring Recipes book for this.

The book has ton of examples that you can apply to your applications. It provides detailed examples (called recipes) based on a scenario that you would encounter in real life.

3) Go to the official Spring site - spring.io

Once you have read the two books, You will have no problem picking short guides and examples from spring.io

Spring Framework official website contains ton of examples but they assume you know Spring concepts already. With the two books mentioned above, you will have the fundamentals to be able to pick up the examples from the site and apply it in your projects.

4) Blogs to stay up-to-date with Spring Framework

I like the following three bloggers for their wonderful posts. Some of them are detailed and provide full background for the subjects. Others are simple and short examples that help you get up and running in no time.

a) Mkyong Tutorial on Spring.

b) Eugen Paraschiv's site Baeldung.com

c) Petri Kainulainen's site.

5) Stack Overflow

Last but not least, If you are stuck with anything specific, Stack Overflow comes to the rescue.

Thanks
