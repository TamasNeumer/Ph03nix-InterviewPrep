# Docker

#### Intro
- Software containerization platform. Provides abstraction of operating-system level virtualization.
- Such containers contain a real Opearting system, SW that I built + dependencies to run the SW.
- Kind of like VM image, but more abstract. Docker shares the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system.
- Not tied to any infrastructure, run on any specific infrastructure, any computer and any cloud.
