# JUnit

#### Intro
- **Text Fixture:** A test fixture is a fixed state in code which is tested used as input for a test. Another way to describe this is a test precondition.
- In the maven project tests go under java/package/classname.java
- Or simply `Ctrl+Shift+T` on the classname in the .java file and you can automatically generate test cases for the functions of the class in intelliJ.
