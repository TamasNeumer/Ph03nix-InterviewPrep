#### Understanding Files and Directories

- **Conceptualizing the File System**
  - A *file* is record within a  le system that stores user and system data.
  - A *directory* is a record within a file system that contains files as well as other directories.
  - The *root directory* is the topmost directory in the file system, from which all files and directories inherit.
  - The *file system* is in charge of reading and writing data within a computer.
  - A* *path* is a `String` representation of a file or directory within a file system.
- **The File Class**
  - `java.io.File`
  - An instance of a `File` class represents the pathname of a particular file or directory.
  - The `File` class cannot read or write data within a file, although it can be passed as a reference to many stream classes to read or write data, as you shall see in the next section.
  - **Creating a File object**
    - A File object often is initialized with `String` containing either an absolute or relative path to the file or directory within the file system.
    - To find out the System's separator character:
      - `System.out.println(System.getProperty("file.separator"));`
      - `System.out.println(java.io.File.separator);`
    - Construction using the constructor:
      - Absolute path: `File file = new File("/home/smith/data/zoo.txt");`
      - Relative path: `File child = new File(parent,"data/zoo.txt");`
        - If the parent object happened to be `null`, then it would be skipped and the method would revert to our single String constructor.
  - **Common methods**
    - `exists(), getName(), getAbsolutePath(), isDirectory(), isFile(), length(), lastModified(), delete(), renameTo(File), mkdir(), mkdirs(), getParent(), listFiles()`

#### Introducing Streams

- **I/O Stream Fundamentals**
  - The contents of a file may be accessed or written via a stream, which is a list of data elements presented sequentially.
  - Java provides three built-in streams, `System.in`, `System.err`, and `System.out`
- **Byte Streams vs. Character Streams**
  - The stream classes (`FileInputStream`) are used for inputting and outputting all types of binary or byte data.
  - The reader and writer classes (`FileReader`) are used for inputting and outputting only character and `String` data.
- **Low-leve vs High level streams**
  - Most `Input` stream classes have a corresponding Output class and vice versa.
  - Most `Reader` classes have a corresponding `Writer` class.
  - There are exceptions to this rule. For the exam, you should know that `PrintWriter` has no accompanying `PrintReader` class. Likewise, the `PrintStream` class has no corresponding `InputStream` class.
  - A *low-level* stream connects directly with the source of the data, such as a  le, an array, or a String. Low-level streams process the raw data or resource and are accessed in a direct and un filtered manner. For example, a FileInputStream is a class that reads  le data one byte at a time.
  - Alternatively, a *high-level* stream is built on top of another stream using wrapping.
    - `BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("zoo-data.txt"))`
- **Stream Base Classes**
  - The `java.io` library de nes four abstract classes that are the parents of all stream classes de ned within the API: `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Reader`, and `Writer`
- **Decoding Java I/O Class Names**
  - A class with the word `InputStream` or `OutputStream` in its name is used for reading or writing binary data, respectively.
  - A class with the word `Reader` or `Writer` in its name is used for reading or writing character or string data, respectively.
  - Most, but not all, input classes have a corresponding output class.
  - A low-level stream connects directly with the source of the data.
  - A high-level stream is built on top of another stream using wrapping.
  - A class with `Buffered` in its name reads or writes data in groups of bytes or characters and often improves performance in sequential file systems.
- **Common Stream Operations**
  - Closing the stream via the `close()` function.
  - Flushing: sometimes the OS doesn't write immediately to the file, but caches it first. The `flush()` requests that all accumulated data be written immediately to disk. Note: the `close()` method automatically calls the `flush()` before.
  - `mark(int), reset(), .markSupported()`
    - First check if marking is supported by the stream. If not and you want to use it, then you will get a runtime exception.
    - `mark(int)` - You can then read as many bytes as you want up to the limit value. If at any point you want to go back to the earlier position where you last called `mark()`, then you just call `reset()` and the stream will “revert” to an earlier state.
    - If you call `reset()` after you have passed your `mark()` read limit, an exception may be thrown at runtime since the marked position may become invalidated.
  - `long skip(long)`
    - It returns a long value, which indicates the number of bytes that were **actually** skipped. If the return value is zero or negative, such as if the end of the stream was reached, no bytes were skipped.

#### Working with streams

- `FileInputStream, FileOutputStream`
  - Take a `String` or a `File` as arguments for their constructors representing the path.
  - The data in a `FileInputStream` object is commonly accessed by successive calls to the `read()` method until a value of -1 is returned, indicating that the end of the stream.
  - A `FileOutputStream` object is accessed by writing successive bytes using the `write(int)` method.

    ```java
    public static void copy(File source, File destination) throws IOException {
      try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(source);
      OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(destination)) { int b;
        while((b = in.read()) != -1)
          out.write(b);
      } }
    ```

- `BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream`
  - Instead of reading the data one byte at a time, we use the underlying r`ead(byte[])` method of `BufferedInputStream`, which returns the number of bytes read into the provided byte array.
  - The number of bytes read is important for two reasons.
    - First, if the value returned is 0, then we know that we have reached the end of the file
    - Second, the last read of the  le will likely only partially  ll the byte array, since it is unlikely for the  le size to be an exact multiple of our buffer array size. (The remaining bytes of the array will be  lled with leftover data from the previous read that should be discarded.
  - The data is written into the `BufferedOutputStream` using the `write(byte[],int,int)` method, which takes as input a byte array, an offset, and a length value, respectively.)I

    ```java
    public static void copy(File source, File destination) throws IOException {
      try (
        InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(source));
        OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(destination))) {
          byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
          int lengthRead;
          while ((lengthRead = in.read(buffer)) > 0) {
            out.write(buffer,0,lengthRead);
            out.flush();
          }
      }
    }
    ```

- `FileReader`, `FileWriter`
  - `read(), write()` methods defined here as well. Reads `char` values, returns -1 if EOF reached.
  - `   write(String)` is very handy.
- `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`

    ```java
    public static List<String> readFile(File source) throws IOException {
      List<String> data = new ArrayList<String>();
      try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(source))) {
        String s;
        while((s = reader.readLine()) != null) {
          data.add(s); }
        }
      return data;
    }

    public static void writeFile(List<String> data, File destination) throws IOException {
      try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(destination))) {
        for(String s: data) {
           writer.write(s);
           writer.newLine();
        }
      }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
      File source = new File("Zoo.csv");
      File destination = new File("ZooCopy.csv");
      List<String> data = readFile(source);
      for(String record: data) { System.out.println(record);}
      writeFile(data,destination);
    }
    ```

  - Note that here your read the entire lines directly. No need to handle character encoding, no need to manually find the end of each line etc. It just simply works.
- `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
  - **The Serializable Interface**
    - In order to serialize objects using the java.io API, the class they belong to must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface. The `Serializable` interface is a **tagging or marker interface**, which means that it does not have any methods associated with it.
    - The purpose of implementing the `Serializable` interface is to inform any process attempting to serialize the object that you have taken the proper steps to make the object serializable, which involves making sure that the classes of all instance variables within the object are also marked Serializable.
      - Note that the requirement for properly marking an object as `Serializable` may involve nested objects. For example, if a `Cat` class is marked as `Serializable` and contains a reference to a `Tail` object, then the class definition for the `Tail` object must also be marked as `Serializable`.
      - A process attempting to serialize an object will throw a `NotSerializableException` if the class or one of its contained classes does not properly implement the `Serializable` interface.
      - You can use the `transient` keyword on the reference to the object, which will instruct the process serializing the object to skip it and avoid throwing a `NotSerializableException`.
      - Besides `transient` instance variables, `static` class members will also be ignored during the serialization and deserialization process.
    - `public class Animal implements Serializable { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; //... }`
      - All that was required to make our previous `Animal` class serializable in Java was to add implements `Serializable` to the class definition.
      - Notice that we also added a variable called `serialVersionUID`. Although this is certainly not required as part of implementing the `Serializable` interface, it is considered a good practice to do so and update this static class variable anytime you modify the class.
      - The serialization process uses the `serialVersionUID` to identify uniquely a version of the class.
  - **Serializing and Deserializing Objects**
    - `ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`
      - `writeObject(Object)` used to serialize and `Object readObject()` to deserialize.

    ```java
    public static List<Animal> getAnimals(File dataFile) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
      List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<Animal>();
      try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(
        new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(dataFile)))) {
          while(true) {
            Object object = in.readObject();
            if(object instanceof Animal)
              animals.add((Animal)object);
          }
        } catch (EOFException e) { // File end reached
      }
      return animals;
    }

    public static void createAnimalsFile(List<Animal> animals, File dataFile) throws IOException {
      try (ObjectOutputStream out = 
        new ObjectOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(dataFile)))) {
          for(Animal animal: animals) out.writeObject(animal);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
      List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<Animal>();
      animals.add(new Animal("Tommy Tiger",5,'T'));
      animals.add(new Animal("Peter Penguin",8,'P'));
      File dataFile = new File("animal.data");
      createAnimalsFile(animals,dataFile);
      System.out.println(getAnimals(dataFile));
    }
    ```

  - **Understanding Object Creation**
    - When you deserialize an object, the constructor of the serialized class is not called.
    - Java calls the first no-arg constructor for the first nonserializable parent class, skipping the constructors of any serialized class in between. Furthermore, any `static` variables or default initializations are ignored.
    - **Important** transient means that the **value** won't be stored while serializing. The field itself is stored! Hence if you have transient variables `String` and `int`, then it will be serialized as `null`, and `0`. For the `static` variable the last used value is stored in the serialized object.

- `PrintStream`, `PrintWrtier`
  - The `PrintStream` and `PrintWriter` classes are high-level stream classes that write formatted representation of Java objects to a text-based output stream.
  - For the exam, you should be aware that `System.out` and `System.err` are actually `PrintStream` objects.
  - **print()**
    - overloaded with all Java primitives as well as `String` and `Object`.
    - These methods perform `String.valueOf()` on the argument and call the underlying stream’s `write()` method, although they also handle character encoding automatically. You may remember from your OCA study material that `valueOf()` applied to an object calls the object’s `toString()` method or returns `null` if the object is not set.


      ```java
      PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter("zoo.log");
      out.print(5); // PrintWriter method out.write(String.valueOf(5)); // Writer method
      out.print(2.0); // PrintWriter method out.write(String.valueOf(2.0)); // Writer method
      Animal animal = new Animal();
      out.print(animal); // PrintWriter method
      out.write(animal==null ? "null": animal.toString()); // Writer method
      ```

  - **println()**
    - Same as `print` but insert a line break after the `String` value is written.
    - The classes also include a version of `println()` that takes no arguments, which terminates the current line by writing a line separator.
  - **format(), printf()**
    - `public PrintWriter format(String format, Object args...)`

#### Interacting with Users

- **Old way**

    ```java
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String userInput = reader.readLine();
    System.out.println("You entered the following: "+userInput);
    ```

- **New way**

    ```java
    Console console = System.console();
    if(console != null) {
      String userInput = console.readLine();
      console.writer().println ("You entered the following: "+userInput);
    }
    ```
- **reader(), writer()**
  - The `Console` class provides access to an instance of `Reader` and `PrintWriter` using the methods `reader()` and `writer()`, respectively.
- **format(), printf()**
  - The `format()` method takes a `String` format and list of arguments, and it behaves in the exact same manner as `String`.
  - `Console console = System.console(); console.writer().format(new Locale("fr", "CA"),"Hello World");`
- **flush()**
  - The `flush()` method forces any buffered output to be written immediately.
- **readLine()**
  - The basic r`eadLine()` method retrieves a single line of text from the user, and the user presses the Enter key to terminate it.
- **readPassword()**
  - The `readPassword()` method is similar to the `readLine()` method, except that echoing is disabled. By disabling echoing, the user does not see the text they are typing, meaning that their password is secure if someone happens to be looking at their screen.
  - `readPassword()` method **returns an array of characters** instead of a `String`.
  - (If a password that a user typed in were to be returned to the process as a String, it might be available in the String pool long after the user entered it.)
  - `char[] password = console.readPassword("Enter your password: ");`
  - Upon verifying it is advised to clear the array immediately from memory.
