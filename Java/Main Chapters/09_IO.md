# Input Output

1. An InputStream is a source of bytes, and an OutputStream is a destination for bytes.
2. A Reader reads characters, and a Writer writes them. Be sure to specify a character encoding.
3. The Files class has convenience methods for reading all bytes or lines of a file.
4. The DataInput and DataOutput interfaces have methods for writing numbers in binary format.
5. Use a RandomAccessFile or a memory-mapped file for random access.
6. A Path is an absolute or relative sequence of path components in a file system.
Paths can be combined (or “resolved”).
7. Use the methods of the Files class to copy, move, or delete files and to recursively walk through a directory tree.
8. To read or update a ZIP file, use a ZIP file system.
9. You can read the contents of a web page with the URL class. To read metadata orwrite data, use the URLConnection class.
10. With the Pattern and Matcher classes, you can find all matches of a regular expression in a string, as well as the captured groups for each match.
11. The serialization mechanism can save and restore any object implementing the Serializable interface, provided its instance variables are also serializable.

#### TL; DR Reading
```java
// Files.readAllLines reutnrs a List of Strings. Each string is a line in the file.
Path wiki_path = Paths.get("C:/tutorial/wiki", "wiki.txt");
Charset charset = Charset.forName("ISO-8859-1");
try {
  List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(wiki_path, charset);
} catch (IOException e) {
  System.out.println(e);
}

// Files.lines returns a String<Stream>
StringBuilder contentBuilder = new StringBuilder();
try (Stream<String> stream = Files.lines( Paths.get(filePath), StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
{
    stream.forEach(s -> contentBuilder.append(s).append("\n"));
}
catch (IOException e)
{
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// Files.readAllBytes returns a String (of the entire text file)
String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(".../Playground/test.txt")));
```

#### TL; DR Writing
```java
// Files.write can write BYTES to a given path (file). Use String.getBytes() function.    
Files.write( Paths.get("src/main/resources/question.txt"), question.getBytes());
```

#### Streams, Readers and Writers
- In the Java API, a source from which one can read bytes is called an input `stream`. The bytes can come from a file, a network connection, or an array in memory.
- In contrast, readers and writers consume and produce
sequences of `characters`.

**Creating I/O streams**
```java
// Files
InputStream in = Files.newInputStream(path);
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);

// URL
URL url = new URL("http://horstmann.com/index.html");
InputStream in = url.openStream();
```

**Reading bytes**
```java
InputStream in = ...;
int b = in.read(); // read a single bytes
byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(path); // all bytes from path
```

**Writing bytes**
- When you are done writing a stream, you must close it in order to commit any buffered output. This is best done with a try-with-resources statement.

```java
OutputStream out = ...;
int b = ...;
out.write(b);
byte[] bytes = ...;
out.write(bytes);

try (OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path)) {
  out.write(bytes);
}
try (InputStream in = ...; OutputStream out = ...) {
  in.transferTo(out);
}
```

**Character Encodings**
- It then matters how characters are encoded into bytes.
- Java uses the Unicode standard for characters. Each character or “code point” has a 21-bit integer number.
- The most common encoding is UTF-8, which encodes each Unicode code point into a sequence of one to four bytes.
- Another common encoding is UTF-16, which encodes each Unicode code point into one or two 16-bit values (see Table 9-2). This is the encoding used in Java strings.

**Text input**
- To read text input, use a `Reader`. You can obtain a `Reader` from any input stream with the `InputStreamReader` adapter
- The Files.lines method allows read a file line by line, offering a stream. This stream can be filtered and mapped.

```java
InputStream inStream = ...;
Reader in = new InputStreamReader(inStream, charset);

String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(".../Playground/test.txt")));
List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(".../Playground/test.txt"));

Files.lines(new File("input.txt").toPath())
    .map(s -> s.trim())
 .filter(s -> !s.isEmpty())
 .forEach(System.out::println);
```

**Text output**
```java
OutputStream outStream = ...;
Writer out = new OutputStreamWriter(outStream, charset);
out.write(str);

Files.write(Paths.get(fileName), content.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);

FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(fileName);
```

**File Locking**
- When multiple simultaneously executing programs modify the same file, they need to communicate in some way, or the file can easily become damaged. File locks can solve this problem.

```java
FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(path);
FileLock lock = channel.lock();
FileLock lock = channel.tryLock();
```

#### Paths
- A path that starts with a root component is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
- The static Paths.get method receives one or more strings, which it joins with the
path separator of the default file system (`/` for a Unix-like file system, `\` for
Windows).

```java
Path absolute = Paths.get("/", "home", "cay");
Path relative = Paths.get("myapp", "conf", "user.properties");
Path homeDirectory = Paths.get("/home/cay");
```

**Creating files and directories:**
```java
Files.createDirectories(path);
Files.createFile(path);
Files.exists(path)
```

**Copy, move, delete:**
```java
Files.copy(fromPath, toPath);
Files.move(fromPath, toPath);
Files.copy(fromPath, toPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING, StandardCopyOption.COPY_ATTRIBUTES);
```

#### Serializazion
- A serializable class can
add any desired action to the default read and write behavior, by defining methods
with the signature

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException

//e.g.:
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
  out.defaultWriteObject();
  out.writeDouble(point.getX());
  out.writeDouble(point.getY());
}

private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
  in.defaultReadObject();
  double x = in.readDouble();
  double y = in.readDouble();
  point = new Point2D(x, y);
}
```

## NIO
- Java NIO (New IO) is an alternative IO API for Java (from Java 1.4), meaning alternative to the standard Java IO and Java Networking API's.
- In the standard IO API you work with byte streams and character streams. In NIO you work with channels and buffers. Data is always read **from a channel into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel**.
- Java NIO enables you to do non-blocking IO. For instance, a thread can ask a channel to read data into a buffer. While the channel reads data into the buffer, the thread can do something else.

#### Channels and Buffers
- Typically, all IO in NIO starts with a Channel. A Channel is a bit like a stream. From the Channel data can be read into a Buffer. Data can also be written from a Buffer into a Channel.
- There are several Channel and Buffer types.
  - FileChannel
  - DatagramChannel (UDP)
  - SocketChannel (TCP)
  - ServerSocketChannel (Listen to TCP like WebServer)
- Here is a list of the core Buffer implementations in Java NIO:
  - ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer, FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, ShortBuffer

#### Selectors
- A Selector allows a single thread to handle multiple Channel's. This is handy if your application has many connections (Channels) open, but only has low traffic on each connection. For instance, in a chat server.


#### Basic Buffer Usage
- Using a Buffer to read and write data typically follows this little 4-step process:
  - Write data into the Buffer
  - Call buffer.flip()
  - Read data out of the Buffer
  - Call buffer.clear() or buffer.compact()
- When you write data into a buffer, the buffer keeps track of how much data you have written. Once you need to read the data, you need to switch the buffer from writing mode into reading mode using the flip() method call. In reading mode the buffer lets you read all the data written into the buffer.
- Once you have read all the data, you need to clear the buffer, to make it ready for writing again. You can do this in two ways: By calling clear() or by calling compact(). The clear() method clears the whole buffer. The compact() method only clears the data which you have already read. Any unread data is moved to the beginning of the buffer, and data will now be written into the buffer after the unread data.

```java
RandomAccessFile aFile = new RandomAccessFile("data/nio-data.txt", "rw");
FileChannel inChannel = aFile.getChannel();

//create buffer with capacity of 48 bytes
ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf); //read into buffer.
while (bytesRead != -1) {

  buf.flip();  //make buffer ready for read

  while(buf.hasRemaining()){
      System.out.print((char) buf.get()); // read 1 byte at a time
  }

  buf.clear(); //make buffer ready for writing
  bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
}
aFile.close();
```
