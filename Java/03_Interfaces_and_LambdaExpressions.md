# Interfaces and lambda expressions

#### Interfaces
- All interface members must be **public**.
  - "The Java programming language provides mechanisms for access control, to prevent the users of a package or class from depending on unnecessary details of the implementation of that package or class."
  - When implementing these interfaces the functions **must remain public**
  - A class might implement only some of the interface methods, then it is an **abstract class**
