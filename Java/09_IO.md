# Input Output

1. An InputStream is a source of bytes, and an OutputStream is a destination for bytes.
2. A Reader reads characters, and a Writer writes them. Be sure to specify a character encoding.
3. The Files class has convenience methods for reading all bytes or lines of a file.
4. The DataInput and DataOutput interfaces have methods for writing numbers in binary format.
5. Use a RandomAccessFile or a memory-mapped file for random access.
6. A Path is an absolute or relative sequence of path components in a file system.
Paths can be combined (or “resolved”).
7. Use the methods of the Files class to copy, move, or delete files and to recursively walk through a directory tree.
8. To read or update a ZIP file, use a ZIP file system.
9. You can read the contents of a web page with the URL class. To read metadata orwrite data, use the URLConnection class.
10. With the Pattern and Matcher classes, you can find all matches of a regular expression in a string, as well as the captured groups for each match.
11. The serialization mechanism can save and restore any object implementing the Serializable interface, provided its instance variables are also serializable.

#### Streams, Readers and Writers
- In the Java API, a source from which one can read bytes is called an input `stream`. The bytes can come from a file, a network connection, or an array in memory.
- In contrast, readers and writers consume and produce
sequences of `characters`.

**Creating I/O streams**
```java
// Files
InputStream in = Files.newInputStream(path);
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);

// URL
URL url = new URL("http://horstmann.com/index.html");
InputStream in = url.openStream();
```

**Reading bytes**
```java
InputStream in = ...;
int b = in.read(); // read a single bytes
byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(path); // all bytes from path
```

**Writing bytes**
- When you are done writing a stream, you must close it in order to commit any buffered output. This is best done with a try-with-resources statement.

```java
OutputStream out = ...;
int b = ...;
out.write(b);
byte[] bytes = ...;
out.write(bytes);

try (OutputStream out = ...) {
  out.write(bytes);
}
try (InputStream in = ...; OutputStream out = ...) {
  in.transferTo(out);
}
```

**Character Encodings**
- It then matters how characters are encoded into bytes.
- Java uses the Unicode standard for characters. Each character or “code point” has a 21-bit integer number.
- The most common encoding is UTF-8, which encodes each Unicode code point into a sequence of one to four bytes.
- Another common encoding is UTF-16, which encodes each Unicode code point into one or two 16-bit values (see Table 9-2). This is the encoding used in Java strings.

**Text input**
- To read text input, use a `Reader`. You can obtain a `Reader` from any input stream with the `InputStreamReader` adapter
- The Files.lines method allows read a file line by line, offering a stream. This stream can be filtered and mapped.

```java
InputStream inStream = ...;
Reader in = new InputStreamReader(inStream, charset);

String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(".../Playground/test.txt")));
List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(".../Playground/test.txt"));

Files.lines(new File("input.txt").toPath())
    .map(s -> s.trim())
 .filter(s -> !s.isEmpty())
 .forEach(System.out::println);
```

**Text output**
```java
OutputStream outStream = ...;
Writer out = new OutputStreamWriter(outStream, charset);
out.write(str);

Files.write(Paths.get(fileName), content.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);

FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(fileName);
```

**File Locking**
- When multiple simultaneously executing programs modify the same file, they need to communicate in some way, or the file can easily become damaged. File locks can solve this problem.

```java
FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(path);
FileLock lock = channel.lock();
FileLock lock = channel.tryLock();
```

#### Paths
- A path that starts with a root component is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
- The static Paths.get method receives one or more strings, which it joins with the
path separator of the default file system (`/` for a Unix-like file system, `\` for
Windows).

```java
Path absolute = Paths.get("/", "home", "cay");
Path relative = Paths.get("myapp", "conf", "user.properties");
Path homeDirectory = Paths.get("/home/cay");
```

**Creating files and directories:**
```java
Files.createDirectories(path);
Files.createFile(path);
Files.exists(path)
```

**Copy, move, delete:**
```java
Files.copy(fromPath, toPath);
Files.move(fromPath, toPath);
Files.copy(fromPath, toPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING, StandardCopyOption.COPY_ATTRIBUTES);
```

#### Serializazion
- A serializable class can
add any desired action to the default read and write behavior, by defining methods
with the signature

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException

//e.g.:
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
  out.defaultWriteObject();
  out.writeDouble(point.getX());
  out.writeDouble(point.getY());
}

private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
  in.defaultReadObject();
  double x = in.readDouble();
  double y = in.readDouble();
  point = new Point2D(x, y);
}
```
