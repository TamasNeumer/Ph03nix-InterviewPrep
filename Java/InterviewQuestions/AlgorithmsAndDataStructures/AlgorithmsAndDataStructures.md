# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Sorting
#### 1. What is the Big O Notation? What is Time/Space complexity?
#### 2. What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?
#### 3. A text file contains the name of ships and their location in the 2D space. Create a data structure for the ships and use the text file to instantiate instances. Store the instances in a List, and sort the list according to their distance from the center (0,0). (Ascending order.) Hint: Use the COMPARABLE interface! Also do the same using a lambda Comparator.
```
A,1,1
B,2,3
C,4,2
D,5,1
E,2,2
F,3,2
G,2,1
H,0,2
```
#### 4. Implement the bubble sort algorithm! (Hint: Use do-while and stop if no numbers were switched!)
#### 5. Implement insertion sort algorithm. (Hint: use loop labeling)
