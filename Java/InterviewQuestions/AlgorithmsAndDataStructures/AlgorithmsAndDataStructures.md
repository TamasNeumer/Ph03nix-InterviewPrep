# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Sorting
#### 1. What is the Big O Notation? What is Time/Space complexity?
#### 2. What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?
#### 3. A text file contains the name of ships and their location in the 2D space. Create a data structure for the ships and use the text file to instantiate instances. Store the instances in a List, and sort the list according to their distance from the center (0,0). (Ascending order.) Hint: Use the COMPARABLE interface! Also do the same using a lambda Comparator.
```
A,1,1
B,2,3
C,4,2
D,5,1
E,2,2
F,3,2
G,2,1
H,0,2
```
#### 4. Implement the bubble sort algorithm! (Hint: Use do-while and stop if no numbers were switched!)
#### 5. Implement insertion sort algorithm. (Hint: use loop labeling)
#### 6. Implement the quick sort algorithm. (Hint: pivot)
#### 7. Implement the merge sort algorithm. (Hint pivot is the middle. Two sublists on which "merge" is called recursively. Two lists are merged by a separate "merge" function, that uses "pointers"/"indexes" to access the current element to be inserted from both lists.)

## Search
#### 8. Given a sorted array use binary search to find an element.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
#### 9. Describe the iterable interface.
#### 10. Describe the difference between fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators.
#### 11. What is the difference between the iterator and enumerator.
#### 12. Arrays vs Lists.
#### 13. ArrayList vs LinkedList / DoubleLinkedList
#### 14. Tree, Binary tree, Heap, AVL tree
#### 15. Hashmap + Internal implementation, LinkedHashMap
#### 16. Treemap - big O?
#### 17. Sets
#### 18. Discuss the differences between HashTable and HashMap.
#### 19. What are the "Views"?

## Algorithms and Datastructure hard-according
#### 20. Given an array of integers return the most frequent element.
#### 21. Given two arrays, return an array that contains the common elements.
#### 22. Given two arrays find out, whether they are rotations of each other. (offsetted by x index)
#### 23. Given a String, return the uniqe characters in it. If none found return null.
#### 24. Given two strings find out if they are "one away". (One character change, or one extra/ one too few chars comapred to the other.)
